Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

I am a fourth year Ph.D Student studying Computer Science at the [University of Southern California](https://cs.usc.edu) in the [CPS-VIDA](https://cps-vida.github.io) lab, advised by Prof. [Jyotirmoy Deshmukh](https://jdeshmukh.github.io/). My research interests are in planning for multi-agent systems using aspects of game theory and formal methods. 

I graduated with a BS in Computer Science from the University of Colorado Boulder in 2022. Outside of academics, I enjoy rock climbing, gardening, and I homebrew beer.
